# Supervised-Learning-Challenge
Week 19 HW
When classifying the data while it was unscaled the Logistic Regression model had the weakest score of approximately 0.51 while the Random Forest Classifier had a slightly stronger score of 0.64
However when the data was scaled the results flipped and the Logistic Regression had the highest overall score of 0.76 while the RFC had a lower score of 0.63
This can perhaps show that the attributes that were unscaled for the logistic regression had a higher inpact or weight on the overall classifier score. When scaled that discrepancy is shown by an increase in about 0.25 in the overall score
